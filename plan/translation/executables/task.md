# Phase 4: Executable Verification

## Description
Ensure all executables work correctly. Test functionality end-to-end.

## Approach
- Build complete C++ project
- Run functionality tests
- Verify feature parity with original Rust version
- Performance comparison
- Memory usage validation
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for subsystems
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Regression tests to ensure no functionality loss
- Performance benchmarks

## Status
- [ ] Complete build achieved
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] End-to-end functionality verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility confirmed
