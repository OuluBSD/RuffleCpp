# Phase 2: Build & Error Correction

## Description
Build C++ files and check for compilation errors. Fix header inclusions and dependencies. Create necessary header files as needed during translation.

## Approach
- Compile each translated C++ file
- Address compilation errors systematically
- Create appropriate header files (.h/.hpp) for C++ classes and functions
- Resolve dependency issues between modules
- Ensure proper include guards and forward declarations

## Status
- [ ] Compilation setup complete
- [ ] Error identification phase
- [ ] Header creation phase
- [ ] Dependency resolution
- [ ] Successful builds achieved
